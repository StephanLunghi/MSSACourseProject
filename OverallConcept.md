Matching letters to animals

It would be very fun to create an app for toddlers to use. 
Start up would be a simple menu with "play", "settings" and "exit".
Within settings the user has the option to randomize the alphabet or have it appear in order. 
The left side of the screen will have a letter, and the right side of the screen has pictures of animals. 
The user has to click on the animal that begins with the letter in order to continue.
A red X appears over the animal if the user is wrong and a box that reads "Try Again" will appear. 
When the user chooses the correct animal there is a cheer and it moves to the next letter. 
After the user completes the alphabet there is a congratulations screen and there is an option to "play again" or "exit". 


After "play" is chosen on the main menu the screen will show a letter on the left side, and 3 animals on the right side. 
When the screen first opens voice will occur saying the name of the letter, and the sound the letter makes. 
When the correct animal is chosen voice will say the name of the animal followed by the sound the letter makes, and will repeat the animal name. 
There will be no typing with this application, as the user shouldn't be able to read yet! 
Only point and click with the mouse will be available. I would also like to enable touch response, we'll see how that goes.
